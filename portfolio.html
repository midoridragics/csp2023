    <h1>Temple Run: My partner and I created a temple run game, featuring a character who runs through the jungle while collecting coins and dodging enemies. The game is based on a "cop chase" game with a similar objective, but we chose to add different obstacles, backgrounds, and animations of the runner character. Each coin = 10 points on the counter, and the final score is displayed on a leaderboard. </h1>

    <h1>3.1.6 Rover Data: In this project, we examined some data that we collected from a lost rover exploring on an alien planet. Based on data from light, temperature, sound, and gyroscope sensors, we tried to determine the region the rover was located in. After drawing the graphs and analyzing the data, we determined that the region is Inland Forest.  </h1>
